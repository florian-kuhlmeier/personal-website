I’m a PhD candidate at the [University of Greifswald](https://psychologie.uni-greifswald.de/43051/lehrstuehle-ii/klinische-psychologie-und-psychotherapie/) and the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://issd.iism.kit.edu/). My research is on how to design conversational agents to tackle symptoms of depression. I'm also interested in statistics and data visualisation, personal knowledge management and I’m a supporter of open science. Over time, I’ll try to write about the things I learn and do.
